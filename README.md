# Package GetLattesData

[Lattes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/) is an unique and largest platform for academic curriculumns. There you can find information about the academic work of **all** Brazilian scholars. It includes institution of PhD, current employer, field of work, all publications metadata and more. It is an unique and reliable source of information for bibliometric studies. 

I've been working with Lattes data for some time. Here I present a short list of papers that have used this data.

- Is predatory publishing a real threat? Evidence from a large database study. [Scientometrics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-018-2750-6)

-  The Brazilian scientific output published in journals: A study based on a large CV database. [Journal of Informetrics](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157716301559)

- The researchers, the publications and the journals of Finance in Brazil: An analysis based on resumes from the Lattes platform. [Brazilian Review of Finance](http://bibliotecadigital.fgv.br/ojs/index.php/rbfin/article/view/47157)    

- Análise do Perfil dos Acadêmicos e de suas Publicações Científicas em Administração (in Portuguese. [RAC](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1415-65552017000100062)
